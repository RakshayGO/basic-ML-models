These implementations of basic ML models can serve as templates for bigger projects, as they contain commented and described code. 
So far it has the following models:
1) MNIST fashion, this uses linearRegression model. To classify a (24 x 24) b/w image into one of the 10 classes. (acc: 88%)
2) cifar-10, it uses CNN to classify the cifar dataset containing (32 x 32 x 3) colour image into 10 classes. (acc: 71 %)
  We could apply data-augmentation and other techiques to improve accuracy.
3) Cats and Dogs
